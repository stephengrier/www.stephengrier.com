title: Unbricking a Tada68 keyboard
categories: [Tada68, keyboards, AVR, electronics]
---

I've been using a [Tada68 mechanical
keyboard](https://drop.com/buy/tada68-mechanical-keyboard) as my daily driver
for the past 6 years. The keyboard is powered by an [Atmel Atmega32U4
microprocessor](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/atmega32u4), and is
fully programmable with firmware such as
[QMK](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).

Recently, I tried to update [my
keymap](https://github.com/stephengrier/qmk_firmware/tree/stephengrier/add_tada68_stephengrier_keymap/keyboards/tada68/keymaps/stephengrier)
with some extra key mappings, which involves flashing the firmware onto the
keyboard. The Tada68 shipped with the [LUFA mass storage
bootloader](https://github.com/abcminiuser/lufa/tree/master/Bootloaders/MassStorage),
which makes it appear as a mass storage device when in bootloader mode. You
can then copy a firmware BIN file to the storage volume, which is then flashed to the Atmel MCU. However, this bootloader is
[known to be very prone to
bricking](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/b108524314047b947031d1cb688e2a378cf586c7/platforms/avr/bootloader.mk#L132)
because computers often don't flush writes to the FAT filesystem before it
resets, causing the bootloader to be corrupted. Unfortunately, this happened to
me.

The only way to recover from this situation is to re-flash the bootloader direct
to the Atmega32U4 MCU using the
[ISP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-system_programming) pins on the PCB of
the Tada68. This requires special hardware, such as an ISP programmer like one
of the many [USBasp
clones](https://hobbycomponents.com/usb-interface/841-usbasp-avr-programmer-adaptor),
or a device that has ISP pins on it, such as a Paspberry Pi or an Arduino board.
Luckily, I had a [Pro Micro](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640) lying around, so I used that.

## Flash a Pro Micro with QMKâ€™s ISP programmer firmware

First, clone the `qmk_firmware` repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware.git
cd git/qmk_firmware/
```

Now, connect the Pro Micro to your computer using a USB cable, and put it into
bootloader mode by shorting the RST and GND pins, then flash the
`pro_micro_ISP_B6_10.hex` file using `avrdude`:

```bash
sudo avrdude -p atmega32u4 -c avr109 -P /dev/ttyACM0 -U flash:w:util/pro_micro_ISP_B6_10.hex
```

If successful, `/var/log/kern.log` should show something like:

```
Mar 31 14:53:53 seg kernel: [15186.630387] usb 4-1: new full-speed USB device number 8 using uhci_hcd

Mar 31 14:53:53 seg kernel: [15186.843530] cdc_acm 4-1:1.0: ttyACM0: USB ACM device
```

## Connect the Pro Micro to the ISP pads on the PCB

You need to remove some keycaps from the Tada68 and unscrew the 6 tiny screws
and remove the PCB and mounting plate from the case. On the underside of the
PCB, at the bottom centre, you will see 7 small through-hole pads. 6 of these
are the ISP connectors, with the ground connector on the bottom left, and the
VCC (5 volt power) on the bottom right. Ignore the single connector on the left.
The connectors follow the 6 pin layout on this diagram:

![](/images/{{ page.id }}/isp_pin_diagram.jpg)

To connect the Pro Micro up to these ISP connectors you will need 6 Dupont
jumper cables with male connectors on one end. The male pins fit exactly into
the through-hole ISP pads.

Be careful not to push the cable pins too far through the holes as they may
touch the space bar stabiliser underneath and short the pins, which could damage
the board.

The cables should be connected to the following pins on the Pro Micro:

| Pro Micro | Keyboard |
|--------|--------|
| VCC | VCC |
| GND | GND |
| 10 | RESET |
| 15 | SCLK |
| 16 | MOSI |
| 14 | MISO |

The rig should look something like this:

## Test your setup with avrdude

Connect the Pro Micro to your computer with a USB cable. Now test you can
communicate with the Tada68 PCB over the ISP connection:

```bash
sudo avrdude -p atmega32u4 -c avrisp -P /dev/ttyACM0 -v
```

If your setup is correct you should see output like the following:

```
avrdude: AVR device initialized and ready to accept instructions

Reading | ################################################## | 100% 0.01s

avrdude: Device signature = 0x1e9587 (probably m32u4)

avrdude: safemode: lfuse reads as 5E
avrdude: safemode: hfuse reads as 99
avrdude: safemode: efuse reads as F3
avrdude: safemode: Fuses OK (E:F3, H:99, L:5E)

avrdude done.  Thank you.
```

## Reflashing the LUFA mass storage bootloader

Some people have reported that they have successfully unbricked their Tada68 by
reflashing the stock mass storage bootloader. This did not work for me, but you
might want to try this before trying a different bootloader.

Clone the `rwilbur/tada68-bootloader-restore` repo and flash using `avrdude`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rwilbur/tada68-bootloader-restore.git
cd tada68-bootloader-restore/
sudo avrdude -p atmega32u4 -c avrisp -P /dev/ttyACM0 -U flash:w:mass_bootloader_tada68.hex
```

If successful you should see output similar to:

```
avrdude: AVR device initialized and ready to accept instructions

Reading | ################################################## | 100% 0.01s

avrdude: Device signature = 0x1e9587 (probably m32u4)

     	To disable this feature, specify the -D option.

avrdude: 32768 bytes of flash verified

avrdude: safemode: Fuses OK (E:F3, H:99, L:5E)

avrdude done.  Thank you.
```

You can now unplug the Pro Micro and disconnect the jumper cables, and connect
the Tada68 to your computer using a USB cable and try flashing your keyboard
firmware to the Tada68 by pressing the reset buttom and waiting for it to appear
as a storage device.

## Flashing the Atmel DFU bootloader

The LUFA mass storage bootloader is very unreliable, so you might want to
consider flashing the Atmel DFU bootloader instead. This is a bootloader
developed by Atmega (now called Microchip), and is generally considered to be
the most reliable bootloader for AVR microprocessors.

Note, there are various bootloaders available for AVR MCUs. For a description of
these, see [QMK's flashing and bootloader information
page](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/docs/flashing.md).

First, download the bootloader hex files from the Microship website:

```bash
wget https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/megaUSB_DFU_Bootloaders.zip -O /tmp/megaUSB_Bootloaders.zip
unzip /tmp/megaUSB_Bootloaders.zip
```

Now flash using `avrdude`, being careful to flash the atmega32u4 hex file:

```bash
sudo avrdude -p atmega32u4 -c avrisp -P /dev/ttyACM0 -U flash:w:/tmp/ATMega32U4-usbdevice_dfu-1_0_0.hex
```

If successful, you should see output like the following:

```
avrdude: AVR device initialized and ready to accept instructions

Reading | ################################################## | 100% 0.01s

avrdude: Device signature = 0x1e9587 (probably m32u4)

avrdude done.  Thank you.
```

You can now unplug the Pro Micro and disconnect the jumper cables from the PCB.
If you now connect the Tada68 to your computer with a USB cable you should see
the following in the kernel log:

```
Mar 31 22:48:57 seg kernel: [20449.798210] usb 4-1: new full-speed USB device number 17 using uhci_hcd
Mar 31 22:48:57 seg kernel: [20449.994550] usb 4-1: New USB device found, idVendor=03eb, idProduct=2ff4, bcdDevice= 0.00

Mar 31 22:48:57 seg kernel: [20449.994585] usb 4-1: Manufacturer: ATMEL
Mar 31 22:48:57 seg kernel: [20449.994591] usb 4-1: SerialNumber: 1.0.0
```

All being well, you can now flash your keyboard firmware to the Tada68 using the
`dfu-programmer` command. Note you will need your firmware in hex file format
file rather than the BIN file format the mass storage bootloader used. I had to
add the following to my `rules.mk` file to get QMK to correctly generate a hex
file:

```
BOOTLOADER = atmel-dfu
```

Flash the firmware using `dfu-programmer`:

```bash
$ dfu-programmer atmega32u4 erase
$ dfu-programmer atmega32u4 flash tada68_mykeymap.hex
Validating...
19310 bytes used (67.35%)
$ dfu-programmer atmega32u4 reset
```

The keyboard should now reset and appear to the OS as a keyboard:

```
