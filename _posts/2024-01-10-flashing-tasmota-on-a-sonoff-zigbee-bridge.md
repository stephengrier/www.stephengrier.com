title: Flashing Tasmota on a Sonoff Zigbee Bridge Pro
categories: [Zigbee, IoT, Tasmota]
---

It's now winter here in the UK, and like many people, I've noticed an increase
in condensation on windows and some external walls in some areas of my home. So
I decided to purchase a number of [Sonoff temperature and humidity
sensors](https://sonoff.tech/product/gateway-and-sensors/snzb-02/) to help me
get a sense of the humidity levels throughout my home.

The Sonoff temperature sensors are
[Zigbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigbee) devices, and can communicate
metrics across a Zigbee network. Zigbee is a mesh network protocol used by
low-power IoT devices like temperature sensors, smart lightbulbs etc. Zigbee
networks require a coordinator to coordinate how all the Zigbee devices
on the network should communicate with one another. The coordinator often also
serves as a bridge between a zigbee network and a standard Wi-Fi or ethernet
network.

In my case, I decided to purchase a [Sonoff Zigbee Bridge
Pro](https://sonoff.tech/product/gateway-and-sensors/zbbridge-p/). I
specifically chose this device because it is relatively cheap, but also because
it is based on the [ESP32
microprocessor](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32), which means
it is flashable with open source firmware such as
[Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/) and [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/).
Flashing with custom firmware opens up various options for integrating with
things like [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) or an
[MQTT](https://mqtt.org/) broker, and avoids having to send data to a
proprietary cloud service such as the [eWeLink Cloud](https://web.ewelink.cc/)
that you would otherwise have to use with Sonoff devices.

I chose to flash the Sonoff Zigbee Bridge Pro with Tasmota. In this post, I will
document the process I followed to do this.

# Connecting to the Sonoff Bridge's UART serial pins

To flash the Sonoff Zigbee Bridge Pro you need to connect to the UART serial
pads on the PCB. Open up the device by removing the four little screws under the
rubber feet on the back of the unit.

There are 5 pads on the PCB labelled `GND`, `GPIO`, `RX`, `TX` and `3V3`. You
can connect to these pads from a computer using a USB-to-TTL serial adaptor such as
a [CP2102](https://www.umtmedia.com/products/cp2102-usb-2-0-to-ttl-uart-module-5pin-serial-convertor)
or a [PL2302](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006127638812.html). You'll
also need some Dupont cables to connect the serial adapter to the pads on the
Sonoff Bridge; I used male-to-female Dupont cables - the pins on the male end
fit into the pads on the PCB, but you can also solder a 5-pin header onto the
PCB for a better job.

You will need to connect up the pins on the Sonoff Bridge to the TTL adapter as
follows:

| Sonoff Zigbee Bridge Pro | TTL serial adapter |
|--------|--------|
| GND | GND |
| GPIO | GND (when powering on) |
| RX | TX |
| TX| RX |
| 3V3 | 3V3 (3V) |

Note, be very careful to connect to the 3V pin on your TTL serial adapter and
__not the 5V pin__! Some adapters have separate pins for these as mine does, but
yours might have a jumper to determine what voltage is provided. If you use 5V
you will fry the components on the Sonoff Bridge, so be careful here!

Also, note that you need to connect the `RX` pin on your adaptor to the `TX` pad
on the PCB and the `TX` pin to the `RX` pad on the PCB.

To put the Sonoff Bridge into flash mode you have to short the `GPIO` and `GND`
pads for a few seconds when powering on the device. I did this by touching both
pads with a screwdriver.

# Prep for flashing

## Download the tasmota image

Next you need to download the `tasmota32-zbbrdgpro.factory.bin` image from the
[tasmota GitHub
project](https://github.com/tasmota/install/tree/firmware/firmware/release).
This image is built specifically for the Sonoff Zigbee Bridge Pro and contains
all the files needed to get the device working with tasmota. You could use one
of the more generic images, but you'd need to follow extra steps to get it
working, so I strongly recommend you use the zbbridgpro one.

## Install the `esptool` flashing tool

There are a number of utilities that you can use to flash the device, including
a number of graphical tools. However, I find that the simplest way is to use
`esptool`, which is a commandline utility created by Espressif for flashing ESP
microprocessors.

On Debian based systems you can install `esptool` using apt:

```bash
$ sudo apt install esptool
```

# Flash the Bridge

If you've successfully put the Bridge into flashing mode, you should now be able
to flash it with the tasmota image you downloaded above:

```bash
$ esptool write_flash 0x0 tasmota32-zbbrdgpro.factory.bin
```

This will take several minutes to complete. If all went well you should see
console output like the following:

![](/images/{{ page.id }}/flash-console-output.png)

# Configuring tasmota

Unplug the serial USB adapter and remove the dupont cables, then power up the
bridge by plugging in the USB cable. If tasmota flashed correctly you should see
a Wi-Fi access point called something like `tasmota-XXXXX-XXXX` when you scan
for networks on your phone or laptop.

Connect to the access point with a phone or laptop and browse to `192.168.4.1`.
Tell tasmota which Wi-Fi network it should connect to and give it the Wi-Fi
password.

![](/images/{{ page.id }}/tasmota-wifi-settings.png)

Once you hit Save it will try to connect to your network, and if successful it
will try to redirect you to an IP address on your Wi-Fi network.

## Device configuration

You would usually need to configure the device in Tasmota. However, the
`tasmota32-zbbrdgpro.factory` image comes pre-configured with the correct
settings. You can see this by browsing to Configuration -> Auto-configuration.
The device should appear as `Sonoff ZBPro`, but if it doesn’t you can select it
from the device list and click “Apply configuration”.

If needed, you can also supply the following config by browsing to Configuration
-> Configure other:

```json
{"NAME":"Sonoff Zigbee Pro","GPIO":[0,0,576,0,480,0,0,0,0,1,1,5792,0,0,0,3552,0,320,5793,3584,0,640,608,32,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],"FLAG":0,"BASE":1}
```

# Flashing the coordinator firmware onto the Zigbee chip

At this point we have flashed the tasmosta firmaware onto the device. We can now
do one of three things; we can:

1. Use something like Home Assistant's [ZHA
   integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/) to control the
Sonoff Bridge Pro and act as a Zigbee coordinator
2. Use [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/) to take control of the Sonoff
   Bridge Pro and act as a Zigbee coordinator
3. Flash the Sonoff Bridge Pro's CC2652 Zigbee chip with [Tasmota's Zigbee coordinator
   firmware](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Zigbee/) and allow it to act as a
Zigbee coordinator (known as Zigbee2Tasmota)

Options 1 and 2 require a separate device such as a [Raspberry
Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) running something like Home Assistant and
possibly [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/) and an MQTT broker such as
[Mosquitto](https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto). If you have something like
this already, ZHA or Zigbee2MQTT are excellent options, and in both cases they
take control of the Zigbee chip on the Sonoff Bridge Pro using serial over TCP;
Tasmota will simply pass bytes between the coordinator and the Zigbee chip.
However, the downside of this is that it couples your Zigbee network to the
device running ZHA/Zigbee2MQTT, and if that goes down so will your Zigbee network.

Option 3 does not require additional hardware; it turns the Sonoff Bridge Pro
into a Zigbee coordinator, and with Tasmota's built in web interface you can use
the device as a light weight Zigbee hub.

It is also possible with Zigbee2Tasmota to integrate your Zigbee devices into
Home Assistant with [Home Assistant's Tasmota
integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/tasmota/). In this
configuration, you would configure Tasmota to send events to an MQTT broker.
This is not documented here.

I chose to go with option 3 and flash the Sonoff Bridge Pro's Zigbee chip with
the Tasmota coordinator firmware.

## Flashing the coordinator firmware

The files needed to flash the coordinator firmware are already included in the
`tasmota32-zbbrdgpro.factory.bin` image. You can see these in Consoles -> Manage
File System:

![](/images/{{ page.id }}/tasmota-file-system.png)

The flashing procedure is carried out from the `Berry Scripting` console. Go to
Consoles -> Berry Scripting.

First, verify that the hex file is okay by doing:

```shell
import sonoff_zb_pro_flasher as cc
cc.load("SonoffZBPro_coord_20220219.hex")
cc.check()
```

If the files is okay you should see the following in the console output:

```
FLH: Starting verification of HEX file
FLH: Verification of HEX file OK
```

You can now flash the coordinator firmware by doing:

```shell
cc.flash()
```

This will take 5 minutes or so to run, during which time tasmota will be
unresponsive. Once back the console should show something like:

```
02:35:29.888 FLH: cc2652_flasher rx=23 tx=19 rst=15 bsl=22
02:35:29.916 FLH: Flashing started (takes 5-8 minutes during which Tasmota is unresponsive)
02:39:35.038 FLH: Flashing completed: OK
02:39:35.155 FLH: Flash crc32 0x000000 - 0x2FFFF = bytes('1598929A')
```

Restart the device by power cycling it, and when back up the console should
report something like:

```
02:42:59.210 RSL: RESULT = {"ZbState":{"Status":3,"Message":"Configured, starting coordinator"}}
02:43:05.011 RSL: RESULT = {"ZbState":{"Status":40,"NewState":9,"Message":"Started as coordinator"}}
```

The main menu should now show the `Zigbee Permit Join` and `Zigbee Map` options:

# Pairing zigbee devices

If the above steps all worked correctly, your Sonoff Bridge Pro will now work as
a Zigbee coordinator. You can now pair it with any Zigbee devices or sensors you
may have. For example, I have a number of [Sonoff temperature and humidity
sensors](https://sonoff.tech/product/gateway-and-sensors/snzb-02/).

First, click the `Zigbee Permit Join` button in the Tasmota web UI. Now, put the
Zigbee sensor in pairing mode - on the SNZB-02 sensors this is done by pressing
the button on the sensor for 5 seconds.

The device should now appear on the Tasmota main menu showing the most recent
sensor readings, as well as the battery power and LQI (which is the Zigbee
connection quality).

![](/images/{{ page.id }}/tasmota-devices.png)

The device name will usually appear as a hexadecimal string like `0xDDA9`. To
change it to something more friendly, do the following in the console:

```shell
zbname 0xDDA9, myfriendlyname
```

Note the comma after the device name! If successful, the console will show
something like:

```
13:08:55.833 CMD: zbname 0xDDA9, myfriendlyname
13:08:55.839 RSL: RESULT = {"0xDDA9":{"Name":" myfriendlyname"}}
13:08:58.342 ZIG: Zigbee Devices Data saved in File System (53 bytes)
```
